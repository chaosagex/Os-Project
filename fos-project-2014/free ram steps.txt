Steps:
1. Add the user programs to your project
2. Add them to the array of user program info
3. Apply the following scenarios

Scenario1: freeing existed processes only
	FOS> load fib
	FOS> load fact
	FOS> run fos_add
	FOS> run tst_freeRAM_1  => it should run successfully
	FOS> runall => BOTH "fib" & "fact" should run
	
Scenario2: freeing loaded processes only
	FOS> load fib
	FOS> load fact
	FOS> run tst_freeRAM_1  => it should run successfully
	FOS> runall => AT MOST ONE of "fib" or "fact" should run 
	
Scenario3: freeing exited & loaded processes 
	FOS> run tst_freeRAM_2  => it should run successfully 
	FOS> printall => No processes should be exist in either new or ready queue
